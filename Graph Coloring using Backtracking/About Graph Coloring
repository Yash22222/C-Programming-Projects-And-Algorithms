What is a graph coloring problem?

Graph coloring problem involves assigning colors to certain elements of a graph subject to certain restrictions and constraints. This has found applications in numerous fields of computer science. 

For example:

1] Sudoku: This game is a variation of the Graph coloring problem where every cell denotes a node (or vertex) and there exists an edge between two nodes if the nodes are in the same row or same column or same block.

2] Geographical maps: There can be cases when no two adjacent cities/states can be assigned the same color in the maps of countries or states. In this case, only four colors would be sufficient to color any map.
Vertex coloring is the most commonly encountered graph coloring problem. The problem states that given m colors, determine a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices are assigned the same color.
