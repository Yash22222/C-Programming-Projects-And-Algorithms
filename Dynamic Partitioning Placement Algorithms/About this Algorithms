Dynamic Partitioning Placement Algorithms  i.e. Best Fit, First Fit, Worst-Fit, etc.

In the operating system, the following are four common memory management techniques. 

Single contiguous allocation: Simplest allocation method used by MS-DOS. All memory (except some reserved for OS) is available to a process. 

Partitioned allocation: Memory is divided into different blocks or partitions. Each process is allocated according to the requirement. 

Paged memory management: Memory is divided into fixed-sized units called page frames, used in a virtual memory environment. 

Segmented memory management: Memory is divided into different segments (a segment is a logical grouping of the process’ data or code).In this management, allocated memory doesn’t have to be contiguous. 

Most of the operating systems (for example Windows and Linux) use Segmentation with Paging. A process is divided into segments and individual segments have pages. 

In Partition Allocation, when there is more than one partition freely available to accommodate a process’s request, a partition must be selected. To choose a particular partition, a partition allocation method is needed. A partition allocation method is considered better if it avoids internal fragmentation. 

When it is time to load a process into the main memory and if there is more than one free block of memory of sufficient size then the OS decides which free block to allocate.

There are different Placement Algorithm:

A. First Fit

B. Best Fit

C. Worst Fit

D. Next Fit
