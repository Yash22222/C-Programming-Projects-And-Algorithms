Disk Scheduling:- FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, CSCAN, LOOK, C-LOOK.

Disk scheduling is done by operating systems to schedule I/O requests arriving for the disk. Disk scheduling is also known as I/O Scheduling.

Improtance of Disk Scheduling in Operating System
Multiple I/O requests may arrive by different processes and only one I/O request can be served at a time by the disk controller. Thus other I/O requests need to wait in the waiting queue and need to be scheduled.
Two or more requests may be far from each other so this can result in greater disk arm movement.
Hard drives are one of the slowest parts of the computer system and thus need to be accessed in an efficient manner.
Here, we will cover the following Topics in Disk Scheduling.
